### Waveform Data

##### Each of the following files contains one hdf5 (data) and one CSV (metadata) files for ~ 200k 3C waveforms. 

https://rebrand.ly/chunk1  (chunk1 ~ 14.6 GB) Noise

https://rebrand.ly/chunk2  (chunk2 ~ 13.7 GB) Local Earthquakes

https://rebrand.ly/chunk3  (chunk3 ~ 13.7 GB) Local Earthquakes

https://rebrand.ly/chunk4  (chunk4 ~ 13.7 GB) Local Earthquakes

https://rebrand.ly/chunk5  (chunk5 ~ 13.7 GB) Local Earthquakes

https://rebrand.ly/chunk6  (chunk6 ~ 15.7 GB) Local Earthquakes 

* Note1: some of the unzipper programs for Windows and Linux operating systems have size limits. Try '7Zip' software if had problems unzipping the files. 

* Note2: all the metadata are also available in the hdf5 file (as attributes associated with each waveform).

* Note3: For some of the noise data waveforms are identical for 3 components. These are related to single-channel stations the horizontal channel is duplicated from the vertical channel. These makeup to less than 4 % of noise data. For the rest, noise is different for each channel.

#### If you had trouble downloading the data from above links/unzipping them, you can download the hdf5 and CSV files from following links:
